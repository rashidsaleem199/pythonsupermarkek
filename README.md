Technologies Used:

Python 3.x

Streamlit

fpdf (for PDF invoice generation)

Git & GitHub (for version control)

Purpose:
This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience in building practical Python applications with GUI, file handling, and third-party libraries. It also demonstrates how to deploy Python apps online using Streamlit Cloud.

Future Enhancements:

Adding product categories and search/filter options.

Integrating a database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for persistent product storage.
